//! # Cross-platform [Tablet](tablet), [Pad](pad), and [Stylus](tool) API üêô‚ú®
//!
//! A platform abstraction across stylus APIs, aiming to provide the *union* of platform feature sets so that no
//! expressiveness is lost in translation.
//!
//! This crate requires low-level access to the windowing server, which is provided by many windowing abstractions
//! such as `eframe` and `winit` through the [`raw_window_handle`](https://crates.io/crates/raw-window-handle) crate.
//!
//! To get started, create a [`Builder`].
//!
//! ## Supported platforms
//! See the [`Backend`] enum and [`README.md`](https://github.com/Fuzzyzilla/octotablet/blob/master/README.md)
//!
//! ## Supported Hardware
//! Aims to support a wide range of devices, as long as they use standard platform APIs (ie, no tablet-specific APIs will be implemented).
//!
//! During development, tested on:
//! * *Wacom Cintiq 16* \[DTK-1660\]
//! * *Wacom Intuos (S)* \[CTL-4100\]
//! * *Wacom Intuos Pro small* \[PTH-451\]
//! * *Wacom Pro Pen 2*
//! * *Wacom Pro Pen 2k*
//! * *XP-Pen Deco-01*
//!
//! ## Quirks
//! Graphics tablets, drivers, and system compositors have no shortage of quirks. Some platforms try to correct for that,
//! some dont. While API-level quirks are smoothed out by this crate, per-device quirk correction is beyond the scope
//! of this project and quirked values are reported as-is. Where possible, documentation notes are included to warn
//! where quirks are known to occur. If you encounter additional issues, please submit a PR documenting them.
//! **Guarantees are made only when explicitly stated so!**
//!
//! ## Examples
//! See [the examples directory](https://github.com/Fuzzyzilla/octotablet/tree/master/examples) for how
//! this can be integrated into `winit` or `eframe` projects and demos of the kind of hardware
//! capabilities this crate exposes.
